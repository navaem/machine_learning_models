# machine_learning_models

Run and compare various machine learning models for classification using scikit-learn models and algorithms. These algorithms were tested on the UCI Adult dataset.

## Models include:
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
- Support Vector Machine

## To Train and Test all of the Models
